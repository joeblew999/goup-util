## goup-util self release

Create git tag and trigger GitHub Actions release

### Synopsis

Create a git tag and push it to trigger GitHub Actions release workflow.

This command does:
1. Validates working directory is clean
2. Creates a git tag (e.g., v1.5.0)
3. Pushes tag to GitHub

GitHub Actions workflow then:
- Runs tests
- Builds obfuscated binaries for all platforms  
- Creates a GitHub Release
- Uploads artifacts to the release

Version options (defaults to 'minor'):
  patch      - Increment patch version (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
  minor      - Increment minor version (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
  major      - Increment major version (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
  v1.2.3     - Use specific version

This is a TRIGGER ONLY - no local builds or tests. GitHub Actions does all the work.
