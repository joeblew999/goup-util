## goup-util run

Build and run a Gio application

### Synopsis

Build and run a Gio application for the specified platform.

This command builds the app (if needed) and launches it. The app is automatically
opened using the platform-specific path, so you don't need to know where it's built.

Platforms: macos, ios-simulator (macOS only for now)

Examples:
  goup-util run macos ./myapp
  goup-util run macos examples/hybrid-dashboard

```
goup-util run [platform] [app-directory] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --force            Force rebuild even if up-to-date
  -h, --help             help for run
      --schemes string   Deep linking URI schemes
      --skip-icons       Skip icon generation
```
